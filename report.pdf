2️⃣ INTRODUCTION

The Railway Reservation System is a simple Java-based console application.
It is designed to simulate basic railway ticket booking operations.
This project helps beginners understand how real-world reservation systems work using Java programming.

The system allows users to book tickets, view ticket details, cancel tickets, and check available seats using a menu-driven approach.

3️⃣ AIM OF THE PROJECT

The main aim of this project is to develop a simple Railway Reservation System using Java that performs basic ticket booking and cancellation operations.

4️⃣ OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The objectives of this project are:

To understand basic Java programming concepts

To implement menu-driven programs

To use conditional statements and loops

To simulate a real-life railway reservation system

To gain hands-on experience with Java console applications

5️⃣ PROBLEM STATEMENT

Manual railway ticket booking can be time-consuming and error-prone.
There is a need for a simple computerized system that can manage ticket booking, cancellation, and seat availability efficiently.

This project solves the problem by automating the basic railway reservation process using Java.

6️⃣ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Hardware Requirements:

Computer or Laptop

Minimum 4GB RAM

Software Requirements:

Java JDK

Any Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans)

Windows / Linux Operating System

7️⃣ SYSTEM DESIGN

The Railway Reservation System follows a menu-driven design.
The user interacts with the system by selecting options from a menu displayed on the console.

Based on the user’s choice, the system performs the corresponding operation such as booking or canceling tickets.

8️⃣ ALGORITHM

Start the program

Display the main menu

Accept user choice

If choice is booking, book ticket

If choice is view, display ticket details

If choice is cancel, cancel ticket

If choice is check seats, display available seats

Repeat steps until exit

Stop the program

9️⃣ MODULE DESCRIPTION
🔹 Ticket Booking Module

This module allows the user to book a railway ticket by entering passenger name and train number.
The available seats are reduced after successful booking.

🔹 Ticket Viewing Module

This module displays the passenger details and ticket status.

🔹 Ticket Cancellation Module

This module cancels the booked ticket and increases the available seat count.

🔹 Seat Availability Module

This module displays the number of seats currently available.

🔟 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The project is implemented using Java programming language.
It uses Scanner class for user input and conditional statements for decision making.
A loop is used to repeatedly display the menu until the user exits.

1️⃣1️⃣ OUTPUT

(Attach screenshots of program output here)

Example outputs:

Menu screen

Ticket booking screen

Ticket cancellation screen

Available seats screen

1️⃣2️⃣ ADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM

Simple and easy to use

Reduces manual work

Fast ticket booking process

Beginner-friendly Java project

1️⃣3️⃣ LIMITATIONS OF THE SYSTEM

Only one ticket can be booked at a time

No database is used

No multiple train support

Console-based only

1️⃣4️⃣ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Add database connectivity

Support multiple passengers

Add multiple trains

Create GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX

1️⃣5️⃣ CONCLUSION

The Railway Reservation System project successfully demonstrates the use of Java programming to implement a real-life application.
This project helps beginners understand core Java concepts and builds confidence in developing simple software systems.
